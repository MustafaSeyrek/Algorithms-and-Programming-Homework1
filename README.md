Assume that there is a “Jackpot Machine” with three reels.
Each reel has letters between A and E (A, B, C, D, E) in the different 3 colors (red, blue, and green).
The player pulls a handle to rotate the reels. The amount the player wins (or losses) depends on the letters and their colors
that land along the pay line.
- If each reel shows the same letter in the same color, he wins $22
- If each reel shows the same letter in the different colors, he wins $20 
- If each reel shows the same letter, but not all the same or different color, he wins $18 
- If the reels show consecutive letters in the same color, he wins $16 
- If the reels show consecutive letters in the different colors, he wins $14 
- If the reels show consecutive letters, but not all the same or different color, he wins $12 
- If the reels show the same color, but not all the same letter and not consecutive, he wins $10 
- If the reels show the different colors, but not all the same letter and not consecutive, he wins $8 
- otherwise he loses (he gets $0)
Write a program that randomly generates the values of the reels and then print the money the player gets.
Don’t use array data structure.
